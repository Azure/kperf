# kperf - a kube-apiserver benchmark tool

kperf is a benchmarking tool for the Kubernetes API server that allows users to
conduct high-load testing on simulated clusters. Its primary purpose is to emulate
clusters larger than the actual environment, helping to uncover potential control
plane issues based on the user's workload scale. This tool provides an efficient,
cost-effective way for users to validate the performance and stability of their
Kubernetes API server.

# Why kperf?

kperf offers unique advantages over tools like kubemark by simulating a broader
range of traffic patterns found in real Kubernetes workloads. While kubemark
primarily emulates kubelet traffic, kperf can replicate complex interactions
typically associated with controllers, operators, and daemonsets. This includes
scenarios like stale list requests from the API server cache, quorum-based list
operations that directly impact etcd, and informer cache lists and watch behaviors.
By covering these additional traffic types, kperf provides a more comprehensive
view of control plane performance and stability, making it an essential tool for
understanding how a cluster will handle high-load scenarios across diverse workload patterns.

## Getting Started

See documentation on [Getting-Started](/docs/getting-started.md)

## Running in Cluster

The `kperf` commands offer low-level functions to measure that target kube-apiserver.
You may need example to combine these functions to run example benchmark test.

See documentation on [runkperf](/docs/runkperf.md) for more detail.
